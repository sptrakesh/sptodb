    API documentation for the <a href='http://sptci.com/' target='_new'>SPT</a>
    <a href='https://sptodb.dev.java.net/' target='_new'>Object Database</a>.
    The database engine is implemented using
    <a href='http://www.prevayler.org/' target='_new'>Prevayler</a> as
    the transactional serialisation engine.  The database engine attempts to
    provide features that are normal for an object database over and above
    the features made available by Prevayler.
  </p>

  <p>The following are core features provided by the database:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Transparent persistence of complex object graphs.</li>
    <li>Persistence by reachability on preavlent objects in the object
    graph that have not yet been persisted.  Note that persistence by
    reachability applies both to {@link com.sptci.prevayler.transaction.Add}
    and {@link com.sptci.prevayler.transaction.Update} transactions.</li>
    <li>Annotations based indexing and constraints.</li>
    <li>Managed relationships to automatically manage references when
    persistent objects are deleted from the prevalent system.</li>
    <li>Configurable snapshot intervals and mechanism (XML or Java
      serialisation).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The primary classes exposed by the database are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>{@link com.sptci.prevayler.PrevalentObject} - The base class for all
    objects that can be managed using the database engine.</li>
    <li>{@link com.sptci.prevayler.PrevalentManager} - A facade around the
    prevalent system.  Similar to
    <a href='http://docs.rakeshv.org/java/jdo2/javax/jdo/PersistenceManager.html'
        target='_new'>JDO PersistenceManager</a>.  Provides a much more
      natural interface than that provided by prevayler.</li>
    <li>{@link com.sptci.prevayler.PrevalentSystemFactory} - The factory
    class used to bootstrap the prevalent system.  Not be use used if using
    {@link com.sptci.prevayler.PrevalentManager}.</li>
    <li>{@link com.sptci.prevayler.PrevalentSystem} - The primary class wrapped
    by <a href='http://docs.rakeshv.org/java/prevayler/org/prevayler/Prevayler.html'
        target='_new'>Prevayler</a>
    instance.  Users may chose to sub-class this implementation for custom
    management of their prevalent objects.</li>
    <li>{@link com.sptci.prevayler.annotations} - Package under which the
    annotations used to configure indices, foreign keys, constraints etc
    for the prevalent objects are available.</li>
  </ol>
