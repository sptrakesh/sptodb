  <p><b>Note:</b> Users do not normally need to directly use these classes.
  It is better to use the higher level interface exposed by {@link
  com.sptci.prevayler.PrevalentManager}.</p>
  <p>Transactions defined for the prevalent system.  Attempts to provide the
  most common transactions likely to be required of a database engine.  All
  provided transactions are sub-classes of the general purpose {@link
  com.sptci.prevayler.annotation.Transaction} class that may be used to
  execute any transactional method defined in {@link
  com.sptci.prevayler.PrevalentSystem} or is sub-classes.</p>

  <p>The following shows sample use of a transaction:</p>
  <pre>
    import com.sptci.prevayler.PrevalentObject;
    import com.sptci.prevayler.PrevalentSystemFactory;
    import com.sptci.prevayler.transaction.Save;

      final Prevayler prevayler = PrevalentSystemFactory.getPrevayler();
      ...
      ... public class MyObject extends PrevalentObject { ... }
      final MyObject obj = new MyObject();
      obj.setXXX(...)...
      final MyObject newobj = prevayler.execut( new Save&lt;MyObject&gt;( obj ) );
  </pre>

  <p>Please note that even though the transactions in this package are
  genericised, you have to cast the returned values to the appropriate types.
  This is mandated due to the fact that <a href='http://www.prevayler.org/'
  target='_new'>Prevayler</a> is not genericised.</p>
