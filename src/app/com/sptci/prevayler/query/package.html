  <p>Queries defined for the prevalent system.  Attempts to provide the
  most common queries likely to be required of a database engine.</p>

  <p>The following shows sample use of a query:</p>
  <pre>
    import com.sptci.prevayler.PrevalentObject;
    import com.sptci.prevayler.PrevalentSystemFactory;
    import com.sptci.prevayler.query.Count;

      final Prevayler prevayler = PrevalentSystemFactory.getPrevayler();
      ...
      ... public class MyObject extends PrevalentObject { ... }
      final int count = (Integer) prevayler.execute( new Count( MyObject.class ) );
  </pre>

  <p>Please note that even though the queries in this package are genericised,
  you have to cast the returned values to the appropriate types.  This is
  mandated due to the fact that <a href='http://www.prevayler.org/'
  target='_new'>Prevayler</a> is not genericised.</p>
